// This is where we'll globally scope some variables we'll be using. Try to remember this for the futre (hint for when we reset our forms content)
// We console log EVERYTHING. This is the SAFEST way to ensure you're going down the right path.
const searchBar = document.querySelector("#search-form")

console.log(searchBar)

//We'll grab the searchBar variable and call an eventListener on it.
